# nutrin: simple food tracker so you can keep yourself accountable - in progress!

## why I made it 
### Most calorie trackers are not accurate:

<br /> 
Each gram of carbohydrate or protein has 4 calories and each gram of fat contains 9 calories. By calculating the calories from the macronutrients you end up with 1424 calories, which is 44 more calories than what the tracker elvaluated calories. If someone were to unknowingly eat 50 extra calories a week thats 350 extra calories. By the end of the month that is 1500 extra calories which is equivalent to half an extra pound of body weight. And lets continue to a year: 18250 calories or 5 pounds of body weight. You may be wondering, why aren't the calorie counts accurate? Well when companies create nutrition labels, they usually round down, and as a result the more you eat, the less accurate the calorie count becomes. This is an issue for myself because I go through bulking and cutting cycles, and when the calorie counts are not accurate, this messes up with my plans of gaining or losing weight. Thus, the app I am creating does not calculate calories from a nutrition label, but rather the macronutrients. 

### Too many features I did not care for:
