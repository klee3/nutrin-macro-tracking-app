# nutrin: simple food tracker so you can keep yourself accountable - in progress!

## why I made it 
Most food trackers are not accurate: 
![macros](/readmeimgs/macro.jpg) ![calories](/readmeimgs/calorie.jpg)
img[alt=macros] { width: 200px; }
img[alt=calories] { width: 200px; }

Too many features I did not care for:

## try it out
to try it out git clone, `cd nutrin` and run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter run`.
